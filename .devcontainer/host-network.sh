# tunnel, which in practice means a VPN, the real limit is lower, and packets that fit inside
# the container are dropped on the way out with nothing to say so: small requests answer,
# large downloads stop after a few kilobytes, and the failure looks like anything but the
# network. Giving the container a network built with the host's own MTU settles it, and asks

# routes (OpenVPN's def1), and `ip route get` follows both. Any address on the internet will
